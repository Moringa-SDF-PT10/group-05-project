## How It Works

### Movie API Integration

We use TMDb API to fetch movie data including popular movies, trending, and movie details. This is handled in `/api/api.js`, which provides clean async functions like `getPopularMovies`, `searchMovies`, and `getMovieDetails`. API keys are stored securely using environment variables.

### Authentication

User authentication is a simple email-password system using React Context (`AuthContext`). User data is saved in `localStorage` to persist login state. The app provides `signup`, `login`, and `logout` functionality.

### Movie Context (State Management)

The `MovieContext` manages the favorites and watchlist data. It uses Reactâ€™s Context API combined with `useState` and `useEffect` to persist user lists in `localStorage`. It exposes methods to add, remove, check, and update movies in both favorites and watchlists.

### Protected Routes

`ProtectedRoute` component wraps around routes that require authentication. If a user is not logged in, they get redirected to the login page automatically, enhancing security and user experience.

## Usage

After running the app:

- Navigate to **Home** to explore popular and trending movies.
- Use the search bar to find movies.
- Click on any movie card to view detailed info.
- Add movies to your **Favorites** or **Watchlist**.
- Visit your **Watchlist** page to see saved movies, remove items, or clear the list.
- Sign up or log in to save your preferences.
- Access protected pages only if authenticated.
